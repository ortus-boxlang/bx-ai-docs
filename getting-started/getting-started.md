## 💡 Quick Examples

### Simple Chat

```javascript
result = aiChat( "What is BoxLang?" );
println( result );
```

### Structured Output

```javascript
person = aiChat(
    messages: "Extract info: John is 30 and lives in NYC",
    options: {
        returnFormat: {
            name: "string",
            age: "numeric",
            city: "string"
        }
    }
)
println( person.name ) // "John"
```

### AI Agent

```javascript
// Create an agent with defaults:
// - memory from global config (window) by default
// - model and provider from global config
agent = aiAgent( name: "MyAgent" ).withInstructions( "You are a helpful assistant" );

// Run the agent with a user prompt
response = agent.run( "Hello! Remember my name is Alice." );
```
